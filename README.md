Overview
========
Tychus is a tool that allows researchers to perform massively parallel sequence data analysis with the goal of producing a high confidence and comprehensive description of the bacterial genome. Key features of the Tychus pipeline include the assembly, annotation, and phylogenetic inference of large numbers of WGS isolates in parallel using open-source bioinformatics tools and virtualization technology. The Tychus pipeline relies on two methods to characterize your bacterial sequence data.

The first method is assembly based. The assembly module attempts to produce a comprehensive reconstruction of the genome by relying on the results of multiple *de novo* genome assemblies through the use of multiple assemblers. These assemblies are then used to produce a hybrid or consensus assembly with fewer and longer contigs that can be used as a draft genome for further downstream processes such as annotation, a process by which genomic features of interest are identified and appropriately labelled. Assemblies are then evaluated based on common scoring metrics, such as number of contigs, contig size, and N50.

The second method is alignment based. The alignment module attempts to produce a thorough description of your bacterial sequence data by identifying related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the goal of producing SNP phylogenies that can aid in inferring the relatedness and origin of your samples. In addition, information about the types of genes, whether they be antimicrobial, virulence, or plasmids are also identified and can be used for further analysis and interrogation.

Requirements
============

Hardware Requirements
---------------------
  - 16+ gigabytes (GB) of RAM.
  - 125+ gigabytes of hard drive (HDD) space.

The Tychus pipeline is intended to be utilized on Linux servers with large amounts of RAM and disk space with multple computing cores. The requirements listed above are a must for demonstration purposes.


Software Requirements
---------------------
  - Java 7+
  - Docker
    - Windows users should download the [Stable channel](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) release.
    - MAC users should download the [Stable channel](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) release.
    - Linux users can [download](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) the most appropriate version for their Linux distribution.

To check your Java version, type the following command into a terminal:
```
$ java -version
```
-----------

Quickstart
==========
Install Nextflow
----------------
Open a terminal and type the following commands (omitting the '$' sign):
```
$ mkdir tychus
$ cd tychus/
$ curl -fsSL get.nextflow.io | bash
$ ./nextflow
```

If installing Nextflow behind a proxy server, you may encounter the following `error` message:
```
$ Unable to initialize nextflow environment
```
In this case, you can type the following commands to obtain the Nextflow executable.
```
$ wget -O nextflow http://www.nextflow.io/releases/v0.23.0/nextflow-0.23.0-all
$ chmod u+x nextflow
$ ./nextflow
```

### Add To Path
Add the Nextflow executable to your system path. You can accomplish this by typing one of the two commands:
```
$ mv nextflow /usr/local/bin
```
or
```
$ export PATH=$PATH:$PWD
```

Install Tychus Pipeline
-----------------------
The Tychus pipeline can be pulled and installed from Github with the following command:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/cdeanj/nextflow-tychus.git
$ cd nextflow-tychus/
```

Install Docker Images
---------------------
Depending on which Tychus module you would like to run, you will need to download the appropriate Docker image in order to resolve the module's tool dependencies. These can be easilly downloaded by typing the following command(s):
```
$ docker pull abdolab/tychus-alignment
$ docker pull abdolab/tychus-assembly
```
The download time will take between 5 and 10 minutes depending on your connection speed.

----------

Run a Test
==========
It is `recommended` that you run these tests for both the `alignment` and `assembly` modules before doing any large-scale analysis. This serves the purpose of getting you comfortable with running each Tychus module, as well as providing you with real output, which you can look back upon later when you get to the [Results](https://github.com/cdeanj/nextflow-tychus#results) section. The reads used in each test were produced with [Art](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/resources/software/biostatistics/art/), an artificial read simulator, and constructed with 20x-30x coverage.

Alignment Module
----------------
Included in the `alignment` module are four databases: a resistance, virulence, plasmid, and reference. These are used by default when running data through this module. The simulated reads mentioned above are also used and can be found in the `tutorial/raw_sequence_data/` directory. To get started, run the following command within the `nextflow-tychus/` directory:
```
$ nextflow run alignment.nf -profile alignment --threads 2 --output my_alignment_output
```

Results should be produced shortly, and you will see the following message:
```
Nextflow Version:	0.23.0
Command Line:		nextflow run alignment.nf -profile alignment --threads 2 --output my_alignment_output
Container:			abdolab/tychus-alignment
Duration:			5m 28s
Output Directory:	/home/username/nextflow-tychus/my_alignment_output
```

Assembly Module
---------------
Included in the `assembly` module is a reference to the simulated reads mentioned above. You will not need to specify the location of any reads in this example. To get started, run the following command within the `nextflow-tychus/` directory:
```
$ nextflow run assembly.nf -profile assembly --threads 2 --output my_assembly_output
```

Since we are doing *de novo* assemblies, this could take a while, but hopefully not too long! When everything is said and done, you should see the following message:
```
Nextflow Version:       0.23.0
Command Line:           nextflow run assembly.nf -profile assembly --threads 2 --output my_assembly_output
Container:              abdolab/tychus-assembly
Duration:               15m 28s
Output Directory:       /home/username/nextflow-tychus/my_assembly_output
```

See below for a list of available options included in each Tychus module.

----------------

Example Usage
=============
FASTQ Input
-----------
The most useful command for both modules will be to read in your sequence data. With Nextflow, we can specify a command line glob to provide a directory of FASTQ files as input. Doing so will allow Nextflow to process data in parallel, using multiple processors. For example, a typical command may look like the following:

```
$ nextflow run <module-name> -profile <profile-name> --read_pairs "tutorial/raw_sequence_data/*_R{1,2}_001.fastq.gz"
```

Here, we are using the `*` wildcard to grab all files within the `tutorial/raw_sequence_data/` directory. The `{1,2}` wildcards allows us to further group the files based on the presence of an `_R1` or `_R2` substring. What is returned is essentially a sorted list of files that Nextflow can group together and process appropriately.

Trimmomatic Operations
----------------------
You may want to use your own trimming operations instead of the defaults provided by each module. To change them you can enter the following command:
```
$ nextflow run <module-name> -profile <profile-name> --read_pairs "tutorial/raw_sequence_data/*_R{1,2}_001.fastq.gz" --leading 5 --trailing 5 --slidingwindow 5:16 --minlen 45
```

kSNP Operations
---------------
By default, maximum likelihood (ML) trees are computed with kSNP. Although this is the `recommended` tree format to produce, you can specify the neighbor joining (NJ) method by including the `--NJ` option. Furthermore, you can enter a decimal number between 0 and 1 specifying the fraction of loci that must be present in all genomes to be included in the resulting SNP phylogeny.
```
$ nextflow run alignment.nf -profile alignment --read_pairs "tutorial/raw_sequence_data/*_R{1,2}_001.fastq.gz" --NJ --min_frac 0.85
```

Figtree Options
---------------
By deafult the SNP phylogenies produced by kSNP are written to a [Newick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newick_format) formatted `.tre` file. Figtree is used to produce phylogenies in the image format of your choosing. By default, SNP phylognies are annotated and saved as scalable vector graphic ([SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics)) images. To change this, simply specify an alternative image format (JPEG,PDF,PNG).
```
$ nextflow run alignment.nf -profile alignment --read_pairs "tutorial/raw_sequence_data/*_R{1,2}_001.fastq.gz" --JPEG
```

Prokka Options
--------------
We allow users to annotate contigs using BLAST specific databases. To do this, you must specify both the `genus` and `species` parameters. The default annotation method is to not use a BLAST specific database.
```
$ nextflow run assembly.nf -profile assembly --read_pairs "tutorial/raw_sequence_data/*_R{1,2}_001.fastq.gz" --genus Listeria --species monocytogenes
```

Database Options
----------------
If you would like to specify an alternative `reference`, `virulence`, `plasmid` or `resistance` database than the ones provided, you can do that as well.
```
$ nextflow run alignment.nf -profile alignment --read_pairs "tutorial/raw_sequence_data/*_R{1,2}_001.fastq.gz" --ref_db "path/to/your/reference/db/ref.fa" --vf_db "path/to/your/virulence/db/vf.fa" --plasmid path/to/your/plasmid/db/plasmid.fa --amr_db path/to/your/resistance/db/resistance.fa
```

Other Options
-------------
Here are some more options. The `threads` parameter allows you to control how many threads each process will use. By default, this value is set to 1. The `output` directory allows you to specify where outputs will be stored. The default directory depends on which module you are using. When running the `alignment` module, results will be saved to a directory called `tychus_alignment_output`. When running the `assembly` module, results will be saved to a directory called `tychus_assembly_output`.
```
$ nextflow run <module-name> -profile <profile-name> --read_pairs "tutorial/raw_sequence_data/*_R{1,2}_001.fastq.gz" --threads 4 --output dir
```
