Installation
============

What You Need
-------------
To run Tychus, you will need Nextflow, a DSL workflow framework for running computational pipelines, and Docker, a software containerization platform that resolves dependency nightmares for complex workflows such as Tychus. See below for installation instructions.

   :linenos:

   curl -fsSL get.nextflow.io | bash
   ./nextflow

Docker Installation
